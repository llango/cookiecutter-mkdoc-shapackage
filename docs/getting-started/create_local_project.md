# Getting started

## Create local project

### Setup cookiecutter
To start, install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
`Cookiecutter 1.4.0` or higher):  

`$ pip install -U cookiecutter>=1.4.0`

### Create local project via cookiecutter

Now you can use cookiecutter to generate your Python package project:

`$ cookiecutter https://github.com/mgancita/cookiecutter-pypackage.git`

**If you will be publishing to PyPI, make sure the name of your project isn't already taken as you will be rejected from uploading to an already existing package.**

Now you should have a project directory for your code! Continue on to see how to get it onto GitHub.
